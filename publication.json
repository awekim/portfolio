Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the PATSTAT database, we analyze 3,352,202 inventor pairs from patents filed by US-headquartered publicly traded firms between 1980 and 2015. Our analysis reveals that while a higher degree of knowledge overlap between inventors typically increases the patent output, measured by the number of patents produced, it is associated with lower patent impact and lower patent distinctiveness in the firm's technological portfolio. Notably, the relationship between knowledge overlap and both patent impact and patent distinctiveness exhibits a curvilinear (U-shaped) pattern, suggesting that beyond a certain threshold, increased knowledge overlap can enhance the influence and distinctiveness of inventions.

This study introduces semantic proximity as a novel, text-based approach to assess the cognitive alignment between regional scientific activity and new fields. Drawing on scientific publications from European NUTS-3 regions between 2010 and 2021, we employ BERTopic and BERT-based similarity to map regional knowledge spaces and measure their proximity to quantum science, an interdisciplinary field of high strategic importance. Using negative binomial regression models, we find that regions with higher semantic proximity to quantum science generate significantly more quantum-related publications. By moving beyond rigid taxonomies, the concept of semantic proximity provides a more flexible and fine-grained tool for analyzing regional knowledge evolution.

Econometric results (pooled OLS and GLM for binary entry, with region/subject/period fixed effects and controls for the regional economy and knowledge base) indicate that higher relatedness density significantly raises the likelihood of scientific entry. The effect is stronger in non-metropolitan regions and when a subject's initial RSA is very low, con- sistent with relatedness seeding new capabilities rather than merely consolidating near-threshold strengths.

Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification.

This study categorizes inventors into three primary groups: engineers, designers, and design engineers based on the type of patent applications they hold and investigates their differences in knowledge portfolios and collaboration patterns. The study relies on patent data for 4,665 US publicly-traded firms from 1980 to 2015 from the PATSTAT database, and constructs two networks for each firm period: a social network of inventors and a knowledge network of knowledge elements. Findings show that design engineers are highly connected within the social network but have disconnected knowledge in the knowledge network in comparison to engineers. While design engineers may not be the primary drivers of firms' technological innovations, they facilitate interdisciplinary communication and decision-making, fostering a design-technology integrated new product development environment.

In cases where opportunities for diversification are rather limited, external knowledge that spills over from neighboring regions or from farther away might become an important driver of regional diversification. Despite the relative importance of interregional knowledge flows via collaborative work, we still have a very limited understanding of how collaboration networks across regions might facilitate diversification processes. The present study investigates the diversification patterns of European metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions into new knowledge domains via technology classes reported in patent applications to the European Patent Office. The findings indicate that externally oriented inventor collaboration networks increase the likelihood that a new technology specialization enters a region, but this external orientation is less important for related diversification than for unrelated diversification. Further, the results demonstrate that interregional collaboration networks help diversification into unrelated technologies if external knowledge sourcing is based on a diverse set of regions and if collaboration is intense within companies located in distinct regions. Within-firm collaborations across regions can compensate for missing related skills in metropolitan and in nonmetropolitan regions alike but are especially important in nonmetropolitan regions.

To draw a causal inference between OTT consumption and sleep patterns, the difference-in-difference (DID) estimation method was applied. With the DID approach, a clear distinction between treatment and control groups is essential because the main treatment effects can be screened by the compounding effects. While the conventional way of dividing two groups relies on the selection of limited variables, this study adopted random forest nearest-neighbor propensity score matching based on a machine learning algorithm to divide the two groups. This allows for meticulous matching of the two groups except for treatment. Results show that watching OTT late at night has a significant effect on reducing the total sleep duration on average by about 18–20 min (maximum about 30 min at 95% confidence level) and delaying bedtime by about 18 min (maximum about 26 min at 95% confidence level). This study showed that the selective viewing of content through OTT has the advantage of widening the range of content choices for media users and helping in arranging their time more autonomously, but watching content through OTT late at night leads to media users' departure from the existing sleep routine.},\nauthor = {Lee, Changjun and Na, Cheongho and Kim, Keungoui},\ndoi = {10.1007/s41105-023-00459-z},\nfile = {:C\\:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Lee, Na, Kim - 2023 - The effect of watching OTT late at night on the sleep pattern of users.pdf:pdf},\nisbn = {0123456789},\nissn = {1479-8425},\njournal = {Sleep and Biological Rhythms},\nkeywords = {Causal inference,Media behavior,Media panel data,OTT,Random forest,Sleep duration,Sleep pattern},\npages = {395--407},\npublisher = {Springer Nature Singapore},\ntitle = {{The effect of watching OTT late at night on the sleep pattern of users}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-023-00459-z},\nvolume = {21},\nyear = {2023}\n}"

The Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE) provides the theoretical foundation to bridge the gap between knowledge and productivity growth. The way regional knowledge actually contributes to productivity growth requires a theoretical explanation because knowledge capability is an indirect and intangible input for regional productivity growth. Previous research has shown that entrepreneurship alone is insufficient to drive productivity improvements. We examine how knowledge capabilities lead to meaningful growth outcomes of new firms in a region. This study examines the determinants of productivity growth by analyzing the factors of entrepreneurship and knowledge capabilities at the regional level, especially considering the moderating effect of entrepreneurship between knowledge and regional growth; by comparing different dimensions of local knowledge capabilities; and by aggregating the contribution of knowledge capabilities and entrepreneurship to productivity growth at the regional level. The empirical analysis is performed on Italian NUTS-3 regions by utilizing an integrated data set combining patent data from the EPO PATSTAT database, and regional data from Eurostat regional statistics. This study makes two main contributions to the KSTE literature by linking knowledge, entrepreneurship, and regional growth and by providing empirical results on different aspects of regional knowledge capability.

Entry-relatedness, which has been previously employed to investigate the technology evolution of regional economies, is advanced by introducing a knowledge gravity model. The entry-potential of a newly acquired regional specialisation has been largely ignored in the relevant literature; surprisingly given the high relevance that is attributed to the recombination potential of new capabilities. In other words, just adding new knowledge domains to a system is not sufficient alone, it really depends on how these fit into the existing system and thus can generate wider economic benefits. Based on an empirical analysis of EU-15 Metro and non-Metro regions from 1981 to 2015, we find that entry-relatedness has a significant negative association with novel inventive activities, while entry-potential has a significant positive association with the development of novel products and processes of economic value.

To manage the risk and uncertainty of such product development, especially given the low success rates, product diversification and collaboration strategies can be instrumental for firms. Especially, the differences in product development complexity and market condition among industries require more case-specific implication due to the absence of a universally applicable strategy, even in these two similar industries. To date, little is known or discussed regarding whether product diversification and collaboration strategies work differently by industry and to what extent their impact differs across industries. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of product diversification on firm performance and compares the diversification effects between pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Related product diversification (RPD), which involves diversifying existing product functions, and unrelated product diversification (UPD), which involves diversifying the selling market, are considered here, and their linear and curvilinear effects are examined for each industry. Furthermore, the mediating role of product diversification in the relationship between collaboration and performance is examined to explore diversification through collaboration and the effect of collaboration on firm performance. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level dataset combining a full set of commercialized product information, collaboration, and statistics from Medtrack and Compustat are used. The results indicate that UPD enhances pharmaceutical firms' performance, while RPD and UPD contribute to biopharmaceutical firms' performance. In both cases, mediating effect of product diversification is found; however, collaboration is found to play different roles, thereby showing that collaboration enhances product diversification for pharmaceutical firms, while for biopharmaceutical firms it negatively affects product diversification, but positively affects performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on how diversification should be treated differently across industries by considering product development complexity and market maturity.},\nauthor = {Kim, Keungoui and Lee, Junmin and Hwang, Junseok and Kim, Eungdo},\ndoi = {10.1111/jpim.12620},\nfile = {:C\\:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Kim et al. - 2022 - Related and unrelated product diversification and collaboration strategies Comparison between the pharmaceutical and.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {0737-6782},\njournal = {Journal of Product Innovation Management},\nkeywords = {biopharmaceutical industry,collaboration,pharmaceutical industry,related product diversification,unrelated product diversification},\nnumber = {4},\npages = {559--580},\ntitle = {{Related and unrelated product diversification and collaboration strategies: Comparison between the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12620},\nvolume = {39},\nyear = {2022}\n}"

In this study, we discuss the diffusion and acceptance of SM services in South Korea's mobility market and its prospects from the perspective of socio-technical transitions. We designed a feedback model based on socio-technical system perspective to clarify the causal relationship between information and communication technology innovation and regulation in South Korea's mobility market; further, we applied a system dynamics simulation technique for testing three policy scenarios. We find that the diffusion of SM services is likely to be hampered if the current regulation is maintained and that the regulation reform without special measures could cause taxi services to lose a competitive advantage against SM services. Research and development investment through subsidies from SM services in the taxi industry innovation could encourage competitiveness, which could coexist with SM services, thereby bringing about a social benefit to adopters.},\nauthor = {Lee, Junmin and Kim, Keungoui and Kim, Jiyong and Hwang, Junseok},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102327},\nfile = {:H\\:/Mendeley/Lee et al. - 2021 - The relationship between shared mobility and regulation in South Korea A system dynamics approach from the socio-(2).pdf:pdf},\nissn = {01664972},\njournal = {Technovation},\nkeywords = {Government intervention,Regulatory cost,Shared mobility,Socio-technical transition,South Korea's mobility market,System dynamics},\nnumber = {May 2021},\npages = {102327},\npublisher = {Elsevier Ltd},\ntitle = {{The relationship between shared mobility and regulation in South Korea: A system dynamics approach from the socio-technical transitions perspective}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102327},\nvolume = {109},\nyear = {2021}\n}"

In this study, the role of online news and social media on people's preventive actions considering the role of trust in citizens and government from the perspective of social capital is investigated.

Our results revealed that the perceived characteristics of online news and social media influence preventive actions through the trust in citizens or in the government. In addition, while online news media enhances trust in both the citizens and the government, social media only influences trust in citizens.

In previous study, firm-level diversification was discussed by different value chains of market, product, and technology. However, in most cases, the diversification itself was adopted in a simple manner although its property contains different aspects and the results varies depending on the diversity property of selected index. In addition, the existing approach for measuring firm's product/market diversification using sales information distinguished by standard industry classification cannot provide direct implication as different strategies are made for market and product diversification. Therefore, this study examines the effects of firm-level diversification on business and innovation performances in pharmaceutical firms by considering (1) three diversification types: market, product, and technology, (2) clear separation between market and product diversification, and (3) two diversification perspectives: balance-centred and hetero-centred. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level data set combining from Medtrack, Orange Book, Compustat and Total Patent database is used. From the result, in case of market diversification, less market heterogeneity causes significant influence on business performance. For product and technology, a concentrated and greater heterogeneity of product diversification are turned out to promote business performance, while the more intensive and heterogeneous technology diversification has been shown to improve innovation performance.},\nauthor = {Kim, Keungoui and Hwang, Junseok and Jung, Sungdo and Kim, Eungdo},\ndoi = {10.1177/09717218211005616},\nfile = {:H\\:/Mendeley/Kim et al. - 2021 - The Optimal Diversification Strategy in Pharmaceutical Industry Balance-centred or Hetero-centred.pdf:pdf},\njournal = {Science, Technology & Society},\nkeywords = {Diversification framework,market diversification,panel regression,pharmaceutical industry,product diversification,technology diversification},\nnumber = {2},\npages = {1--24},\ntitle = {{The Optimal Diversification Strategy in Pharmaceutical Industry: Balance-centred or Hetero-centred?}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1177/09717218211005616},\nvolume = {26},\nyear = {2021}\n}"

We propose several measures of externalities, distinguishing between foreign and domestic spillovers, and inter- and intra-industry spillovers. We focus on domestic spillovers, and compare a standard measure with a measure computed by weighting the ICT capital of other industries with bilateral sectoral trade. We find that results are affected by the way spillovers are measured. Evidence in favour of domestic externalities is only found when using the second measure, meaning that spillover effects only exist among industries that are connected via international trade.

Secondly, estimated TFP is used to evaluate how several types of intangibles and GVC measures affect productivity. Moreover, we use interaction terms in order to estimate jointly the impact of the two factors and evaluate the role of intangibles in the transmission mechanism between GVC and productivity.

The absence of consensus on the selection of suitable technology diversification index, however, may lead to a lack of objectivity with ample grounds. In this study, we focus on the case of technology diversification using patent to derive empirical implication for selecting suitable diversification index. To obtain the content validity of diversification index, three cases were tested: cross section, single and multiple time periods. As a result, diversification indices are separated into two groups: HHI, Gini-Simpson, 1/HHI, and Entropy for PC1 and Variety and Rao-Stirling for PC2. In this context, technology diversification can be explained by two perspectives of diversification: balance-centered and hetero-centered diversification. The balance-centered diversification implies the proportion of elements are the target of interest while hetero-centered diversification refers to variety and disparity of diversification, which focuses on the degree of differentiation among elements. In applicant-level technology diversification studies, these two diversification perspectives are recommended to be used.},\nauthor = {Kim, Keungoui and Hwang, Junseok and Jung, Sungdo and Kim, Eungdo},\ndoi = {10.1080/23311975.2019.1643519},\nfile = {:H\\:/Mendeley/Kim et al. - 2019 - Which technology diversification index should be selected Insights for diversification perspectives.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {2331-1975},\njournal = {Cogent Business & Management},\nkeywords = {diversification index,patent,principal component,principal component analysis,technology diversification},\nnumber = {1},\npages = {1--18},\npublisher = {Cogent},\ntitle = {{Which technology diversification index should be selected?: Insights for diversification perspectives}},\nurl = {https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23311975.2019.1643519},\nvolume = {6},\nyear = {2019}\n}"

In this context, the present study measures firm-level technology convergence (TC) capability using patent network analysis. A firm's TC capabilities are measured using three centrality indices pertaining to a patent network, which is constructed based on the relationship between patents and their international patent classification. For the empirical analysis, panel regression is conducted to observe the effect of TC capabilities on innovation for the top 30 firms in four manufacturing industries. We find that the TC degree positively influences the firms' overall innovation, namely their total number of patents, and negatively influences their convergent innovation, calculated as the ratio between the number of TC patents and the total number of patents, while the effect of TC betweenness is the opposite. These findings imply that while concentrating on similar technologies may promote quick technology application, it could hamper the enhancement of a TC's potential. To promote TC, a firm should thus develop technologies more likely to be involved in TC.},\nauthor = {Kim, Keungoui and Jung, Sungdo and Hwang, Junseok},\ndoi = {10.1111/radm.12350},\nfile = {:H\\:/Mendeley/Kim, Jung, Hwang - 2019 - Technology convergence capability and firm innovation in the manufacturing sector an approach based on patent.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {00336807},\njournal = {R&D Management},\nnumber = {4},\npages = {595--606},\ntitle = {{Technology convergence capability and firm innovation in the manufacturing sector: an approach based on patent network analysis}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1111/radm.12350},\nvolume = {49},\nyear = {2019}\n}"

This analysis administered questionnaires to users of water purification systems installed in five elementary and middle schools in Binh Dinh, from which 296 samples were collected for the final analysis. The original unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was modified by incorporating the factors of physical support and educational support, and empirically studied using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that all constructs significantly affect the behavioral intentions toward AT, of which performance expectancy and physical support have the most significant impact. Thus, understanding local needs and improving the quality of life by spreading AT are key in its acceptance and diffusion. Furthermore, sustainable technology is guaranteed only if human and economic support is accompanied by AT development that fits the local context and environment. Finally, the analysis results, that moderating effects differ by role, imply that educational support's influence varies between manager and student groups.},\nauthor = {Lee, Junmin and Kim, Keungoui and Shin, Hyunha and Hwang, Junseok},\ndoi = {10.3390/su10072255},\nfile = {:H\\:/Mendeley/Lee et al. - 2018 - Acceptance Factors of Appropriate Technology Case of Water Purification Systems in Binh Dinh , Vietnam.pdf:pdf},\njournal = {Sustainability},\nkeywords = {UTAUT model,appropriate technology,empirical study,technology acceptance,water purification systems},\nnumber = {7},\npages = {2255},\ntitle = {{Acceptance Factors of Appropriate Technology : Case of Water Purification Systems in Binh Dinh , Vietnam}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.3390/su10072255},\nvolume = {10},\nyear = {2018}\n}"

Using the exogenous variation, we estimate the impact of the policy on the intention to change handsets and expenses on handset installment, total mobile communications, and online content. The longitudinal data are from the 2014 to 2015 waves of the Korea Media Panel Survey. The mobile act lowered the predicted probability of switching handsets by 0.4% points. Moreover, the mobile act increased the predicted probability of any expense on handset installment by 7.5% points and had a significant impact on the amount of expenses on handset installment, with an increase of 7.8%. The mobile act lowered users' willingness to switch handsets and increased spending on handset installment. This increased burden in handset installment might shrink the online content market, which has a large need for government support, as well as decrease consumers' welfare. We assert that the policy intervention on handset subsidies is questionable with regard to both consumer welfare and the healthiness of the ICT ecosystem.},\nauthor = {Lee, Changjun and Jung, Sungdo and Kim, Keungoui},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.tele.2017.06.017},\nfile = {:H\\:/Mendeley/Lee, Jung, Kim - 2017 - Effect of a policy intervention on handset subsidies on the intention to change handsets and households' expense.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {07365853},\njournal = {Telematics and Informatics},\nkeywords = {Consumer surplus,Handset subsidy,ICT ecosystem,Mobile communication,Policy intervention},\nnumber = {8},\npages = {1524--1531},\ntitle = {{Effect of a policy intervention on handset subsidies on the intention to change handsets and households' expenses in mobile telecommunications}},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2017.06.017%0AGet rights and content%0A},\nvolume = {34},\nyear = {2017}\n}"
