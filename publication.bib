While the process of knowledge exchanges between the nexus is conceptually well grounded in relevant literatures, the absence of quantitative measures and assessments of such linkages may underestimate the importance of scientific knowledge inputs for generating high-impact innovative outcomes. In this regard, we propose a large quantitative analysis on knowledge externalities from science to technology by investigating patent citations to science data across European metropolitan regions. First, we construct a dataset of patent citations to scientific knowledge that includes information on the spatial origins of knowledge spillovers. Subsequently, the ratio of internal scientific knowledge sourcing to external sources and its effect on patent citation impact is evaluated. Findings suggest that regions with a higher reliance on their internal scientific resources tend to generate inventions with higher technological impact, and that a strong connection between science and technology is even more effective in advanced industrial regions.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing awareness on environmental issues, the necessity to implement more sustainable technologies is becoming a central theme for policy makers and economic agents. The beneficial effects of these technologies are not restricted to the environmental sphere, but also concern economic activity. In the present study, building on the knowledge spillovers theory of entrepreneurship, we look at the role of regional knowledge capabilities in facilitating green-tech firm creation in German regions. Exploiting the European Patent Office PATSTAT database in order to build regional knowledge measures, and official German government sources concerning regional green entrepreneurship activity, we consider both knowledge capacity and knowledge diversity aspects. We differentiate patents in terms of quality, using citation-based measures, and adopt a recombinant knowledge approach to account for knowledge heterogeneity. Results highlight the key role played by knowledge capacity measures, such as absorptive and innovative knowledge capacity, in promoting entrepreneurship. Although, among knowledge diversity measures only related diversity is found to promote the creation of new firms.},

In such a situation, a better understanding of the difference in the effects of the different innovation types is needed. However, little is known about the differences in technical efficiency in terms of innovation types. This study compared technical efficiency across different firms that applied different production function technologies differentiated by innovation type. Data from the seventh version of the Workplace Panel Survey of the Korean Labor Institute was used. Manufacturing firms that adopted a single innovation type were included in the final sample, based on the results of an exploratory data analysis. Using stochastic frontier analysis, the efficiencies of the four groups were estimated, and the efficiencies of different production function technologies were compared using meta-frontier analysis. The estimation results indicate that the organisation innovation group showed better efficiency than other groups, while the product/service innovation group exhibited the highest potential in its production technology.},

abstract = {Knowledge has replaced labor as the key factor for productivity growth in innovation discourse. The Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE) provides the theoretical foundation to bridge the gap between knowledge and productivity growth. The way regional knowledge actually contributes to productivity growth requires a theoretical explanation because knowledge capability is an indirect and intangible input for regional productivity growth. Previous research has shown that entrepreneurship alone is insufficient to drive productivity improvements. We examine how knowledge capabilities lead to meaningful growth outcomes of new firms in a region. This study examines the determinants of productivity growth by analyzing the factors of entrepreneurship and knowledge capabilities at the regional level, especially considering the moderating effect of entrepreneurship between knowledge and regional growth; by comparing different dimensions of local knowledge capabilities; and by aggregating the contribution of knowledge capabilities and entrepreneurship to productivity growth at the regional level. The empirical analysis is performed on Italian NUTS-3 regions by utilizing an integrated data set combining patent data from the EPO PATSTAT database, and regional data from Eurostat regional statistics. This study makes two main contributions to the KSTE literature by linking knowledge, entrepreneurship, and regional growth and by providing empirical results on different aspects of regional knowledge capability. Our findings identify which types of local knowledge capabilities are more important and how related innovative activity interacts with entrepreneurial activity, elucidating the mechanisms by which knowledge affects labor productivity through entrepreneurship.},

In this regard, the role of media as an information channel in delivering the reliable information and motivating the active participation of citizens in complying with government's preventive actions becomes much more important. In this study, the role of online news and social media on people's preventive actions considering the role of trust in citizens and government from the perspective of social capital is investigated. For the empirical study, a structural equation modeling is employed by using survey material gathered from South Korea in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. South Korea was selected as its COVID-19 prevention strategy focused not only on the provision of medical support, but also on the enhancement of social trust through active engagement with people through media channels. Our results revealed that the perceived characteristics of online news and social media influence preventive actions through the trust in citizens or in the government. In addition, while online news media enhances trust in both the citizens and the government, social media only influences trust in citizens. Based on our findings, we concluded and discussed the role of media in preventing the spread of COVID-19.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. This study examined effect of a policy intervention that provides an upper limit for handset subsidies on users' intention to change handset and households' expenses on mobile telecommunications. The Korean government has prohibited mobile network providers from providing excessive subsidies for mobile handsets to attract subscribers since Nov. 2014 according to the mobile act. Using the exogenous variation, we estimate the impact of the policy on the intention to change handsets and expenses on handset installment, total mobile communications, and online content. The longitudinal data are from the 2014 to 2015 waves of the Korea Media Panel Survey. The mobile act lowered the predicted probability of switching handsets by 0.4% points. Moreover, the mobile act increased the predicted probability of any expense on handset installment by 7.5% points and had a significant impact on the amount of expenses on handset installment, with an increase of 7.8%. The mobile act lowered users' willingness to switch handsets and increased spending on handset installment. This increased burden in handset installment might shrink the online content market, which has a large need for government support, as well as decrease consumers' welfare. We assert that the policy intervention on handset subsidies is questionable with regard to both consumer welfare and the healthiness of the ICT ecosystem.},

Abstract: Using the case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a natural experiment, this study discusses how innovation policy should be designed in times of crisis when public interest and privacy concerns collide. For this purpose, the causal relationship between social distancing enforcement and innovation adoption in consideration of privacy concerns is explored by using national-level survey data. Our key findings from econometric analysis are as follows: first, the implementation of social distancing policies leads to an increase in the adoption of wearable devices. Second, the strengthening of social distancing has caused a decrease in individual privacy concerns. Finally, a decrease in individual privacy concerns leads to an increase in wearable device adoption. Social distancing during the COVID-19 not only accelerated innovation adoption but also led a decrease in privacy concern},

abstract = {In pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, developing and commercializing products require great investments and intensive clinical trials. To manage the risk and uncertainty of such product development, especially given the low success rates, product diversification and collaboration strategies can be instrumental for firms. Especially, the differences in product development complexity and market condition among industries require more case-specific implication due to the absence of a universally applicable strategy, even in these two similar industries. To date, little is known or discussed regarding whether product diversification and collaboration strategies work differently by industry and to what extent their impact differs across industries. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of product diversification on firm performance and compares the diversification effects between pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Related product diversification (RPD), which involves diversifying existing product functions, and unrelated product diversification (UPD), which involves diversifying the selling market, are considered here, and their linear and curvilinear effects are examined for each industry. Furthermore, the mediating role of product diversification in the relationship between collaboration and performance is examined to explore diversification through collaboration and the effect of collaboration on firm performance. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level dataset combining a full set of commercialized product information, collaboration, and statistics from Medtrack and Compustat are used. The results indicate that UPD enhances pharmaceutical firms' performance, while RPD and UPD contribute to biopharmaceutical firms' performance. In both cases, mediating effect of product diversification is found; however, collaboration is found to play different roles, thereby showing that collaboration enhances product diversification for pharmaceutical firms, while for biopharmaceutical firms it negatively affects product diversification, but positively affects performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on how diversification should be treated differently across industries by considering product development complexity and market maturity.},

abstract = {Since the advent of Uber, various shared mobility (SM) services have been introduced to exploit the blind spot of existing regulations in South Korea; nevertheless, the only limited services have been available because of the opposition from local stakeholders and the government's heavy-handed regulation. In this study, we discuss the diffusion and acceptance of SM services in South Korea's mobility market and its prospects from the perspective of socio-technical transitions. We designed a feedback model based on socio-technical system perspective to clarify the causal relationship between information and communication technology innovation and regulation in South Korea's mobility market; further, we applied a system dynamics simulation technique for testing three policy scenarios. We find that the diffusion of SM services is likely to be hampered if the current regulation is maintained and that the regulation reform without special measures could cause taxi services to lose a competitive advantage against SM services. Research and development investment through subsidies from SM services in the taxi industry innovation could encourage competitiveness, which could coexist with SM services, thereby bringing about a social benefit to adopters.},

In this study, the case of the standards war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray was analyzed with patent data as an empirical case considering a dynamic framework. With this framework, we observed a change in a firm's technology relations and could predict the decline in a firm's preference and the shift of equilibrium ahead of Toshiba's resignation.},

Essays on Annuitization and Housing Choice, For most households in the United States, lahor income is the mo.st important .fource of wealth and housing is the most important risky asset. A natural intuition is thus that households whose incomes covary relatively strongly with housing prices should own relatively little housing. Under plausible assumptions on preferences and distributions, this result holds theoretically. Etnpirically. the results show a signiticant effect: among U.S. households, a standard deviation increase in income-house price covariance is associated with a decrea.se of approximately $2.^,(KH) in the value of owner-occupied housing. The study goes on lo extend the theory of annuitization. It presents numerical calculations of the tinancial benefit and optimal degree of annuitization for consumers with standard CRRA preferences, and compares these results to results where otherwise identical consumers have utility that depends both on present consumption and a standard of living tn which they have grown accustomed. The final chapter in the study addresses the measurement of income sorting and Ihe attribution of observed sorting to different causes.},
