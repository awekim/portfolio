abstract = {The emergence of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) as a transformative mode of transportation is driven by the convergence of advanced information technologies, including automation and autonomous flight systems, with innovative aerial vehicle designs. Positioned as a key component of future smart and interconnected urban mobility ecosystems, UAM has attracted growing attention from both industry and policymakers. This study examines consumer preferences for UAM in South Korea using a choice-based conjoint analysis. The analysis quantifies the relative importance of key service attributes—transit time, price, operating speed, autonomy, waiting time, seat width, and luggage weight—in influencing potential adoption. The results show that transit time is the most influential attribute shaping consumer preferences, followed by price, operating speed, and autonomy. Secondary factors such as waiting time, seat width, and luggage weight also contribute to perceived service quality and convenience. These findings provide actionable insights for UAM service providers and policymakers, highlighting the need to balance efficiency, affordability, and technological advancement to foster consumer acceptance and sustainable market integration. Future research should validate these findings across different cultural and urban contexts to assess the generalisability of consumer preference structures.},

abstract = {This study extends evolutionary economic geography to science by mapping how regional scientific capabilities emerge and evolve across Europe. Using Web of Science publications (2000–2017) geo-coded to 1,216 regions in 35 countries and classified into 228 subjects, we construct a pan-European “Science Space” based on subject co-occurrence and relatedness, and test whether relatedness density, i.e., the embeddedness of a subject in a region's existing portfolio, predicts subsequent entry (Revealed Scientific Advantage ≥ 1). Network evidence shows Europe's science system becoming more interdisciplinary, with technology-adjacent subjects (e.g., nanoscience, robotics, computer science) gaining centrality, while Life Sciences & Biomedicine remain dominant by volume. Econometric results (pooled OLS and GLM for binary entry, with region/subject/period fixed effects and controls for the regional economy and knowledge base) indicate that higher relatedness density significantly raises the likelihood of scientific entry. The effect is stronger in non-metropolitan regions and when a subject's initial RSA is very low, consistent with relatedness seeding new capabilities rather than merely consolidating near-threshold strengths. These findings generalise the principle of relatedness from technology to science and advise regional innovation policy to prioritise adjacent scientific opportunities, invest in bridging infrastructures, and design interdisciplinary platforms where relatedness density is high but specialisation has not yet emerged.},

abstract = {Technological collaborations are crucial for shaping the emergence of new regional technological specialisations. This article explores the relationship between technological networks formed between organisations, within and across regions, and the ability of these regions to branch into new technological fields. To identify the organisations' collaboration structure, we exploit patent co-applicant data and perform a network analysis of the organisations' collaborations for 245 European NUTS-II regions from 1990 to 2016. Panel regression analyses reveal that (1) a more locally oriented and less dense region-internal network, (2) a more diverse set of region-external linkages, and (3) a higher share of single applicants in a region are positively associated with the emergence of new technological specialisations. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a balance between the organisations' inward and outward orientation to acquire new technological specialisations. Regions must leverage both internal technological capabilities and external networks to foster processes of technological renewal.},

abstract = {Integrating design and technological innovations throughout the new product development process is essential for creating market-successful products. This study investigates how firms' capability to effectively combine design and technology—termed design-engineering capability—affects financial performance and moderates the link between innovation activity and performance. Drawing on patent data for 1,659 US-headquartered public firms from 1980 to 2015, we identify design engineers as inventors contributing to both design and utility patents, capturing their role as integrators of aesthetic, functional, and market considerations. Using panel generalised least squares regressions, our results confirm that design-engineering capability not only directly enhances financial performance but also strengthens the positive impact of innovation activity. Firms with higher shares of design engineers achieve greater returns from their innovation efforts, while those with lower integration capabilities may fail to translate technological advances into market success. These findings underscore the strategic value of cross-disciplinary expertise and the need for organiations to foster collaboration between design and engineering functions. By highlighting the performance benefits of design-technology integration, this study contributes to research on innovation management, human capital, and the resource-based view of the firm.},

We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year.

For this purpose, the causal relationship between social distancing enforcement and innovation adoption in consideration of privacy concerns is explored by using national-level survey data. Our key findings from econometric analysis are as follows: first, the implementation of social distancing policies leads to an increase in the adoption of wearable devices. Second, the strengthening of social distancing has caused a decrease in individual privacy concerns. Finally, a decrease in individual privacy concerns leads to an increase in wearable device adoption. Social distancing during the COVID-19 not only accelerated innovation adoption but also led a decrease in privacy concern},

abstract = {Global scientific output is expanding exponentially, which in turn calls for a better understanding of the science of science and especially how the boundaries of scientific fields expand through processes of emergence. The present study proposes the application of embedded topic modeling techniques to identify new emerging science via knowledge recombination activities as evidenced through the analysis of research publication metadata. First, a dataset is constructed from metadata derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The dataset is then used to generate a global map representing a categorical scientific co-occurrence network. A research field is defined as interdisciplinary when multiple science categories are listed in its description. Second, the co-occurrence networks are subsequently compared between periods to determine changing patterns of influence in light of interdisciplinarity. Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification. We present the results of the analysis to demonstrate the emergence of global interdisciplinary sciences and further we perform qualitative validation on the results to identify what the sources of the emergent areas are. Based on these results, we discuss potential applications for identifying emergence through the merging of global interdisciplinary domains.},

Finally, we investigate regional collaboration intensity and how it interacts with brokerage roles, highlighting its mediating effect.

abstract = {The diversification of regions into new technologies is driven by the degree of relatedness to existing capabilities already present in the region. In cases where opportunities for diversification are rather limited, external knowledge that spills over from neighboring regions or from farther away might become an important driver of regional diversification. Despite the relative importance of interregional knowledge flows via collaborative work, we still have a very limited understanding of how collaboration networks across regions might facilitate diversification processes. The present study investigates the diversification patterns of European metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions into new knowledge domains via technology classes reported in patent applications to the European Patent Office. The findings indicate that externally oriented inventor collaboration networks increase the likelihood that a new technology specialization enters a region, but this external orientation is less important for related diversification than for unrelated diversification. Further, the results demonstrate that interregional collaboration networks help diversification into unrelated technologies if external knowledge sourcing is based on a diverse set of regions and if collaboration is intense within companies located in distinct regions. Within-firm collaborations across regions can compensate for missing related skills in metropolitan and in nonmetropolitan regions alike but are especially important in nonmetropolitan regions. These results provide new evidence about the importance of knowledge flows within multilocation firms in the technological knowledge diversification of regions.},

While the process of knowledge exchanges between the nexus is conceptually well grounded in relevant literatures, the absence of quantitative measures and assessments of such linkages may underestimate the importance of scientific knowledge inputs for generating high-impact innovative outcomes. In this regard, we propose a large quantitative analysis on knowledge externalities from science to technology by investigating patent citations to science data across European metropolitan regions. First, we construct a dataset of patent citations to scientific knowledge that includes information on the spatial origins of knowledge spillovers. Subsequently, the ratio of internal scientific knowledge sourcing to external sources and its effect on patent citation impact is evaluated. Findings suggest that regions with a higher reliance on their internal scientific resources tend to generate inventions with higher technological impact, and that a strong connection between science and technology is even more effective in advanced industrial regions.},

abstract = {This study aimed to answer the question of how media users will reallocate their sleep time when their main content channel changes from real-time broadcasting to selective viewing through the over-the-top (OTT) media streaming service. To draw a causal inference between OTT consumption and sleep patterns, the difference-in-difference (DID) estimation method was applied. With the DID approach, a clear distinction between treatment and control groups is essential because the main treatment effects can be screened by the compounding effects. While the conventional way of dividing two groups relies on the selection of limited variables, this study adopted random forest nearest-neighbor propensity score matching based on a machine learning algorithm to divide the two groups. This allows for meticulous matching of the two groups except for treatment. Results show that watching OTT late at night has a significant effect on reducing the total sleep duration on average by about 18–20 min (maximum about 30 min at 95% confidence level) and delaying bedtime by about 18 min (maximum about 26 min at 95% confidence level). This study showed that the selective viewing of content through OTT has the advantage of widening the range of content choices for media users and helping in arranging their time more autonomously, but watching content through OTT late at night leads to media users' departure from the existing sleep routine.},

abstract = {Since COVID-19, social distancing has become common, and the demand for untact ser- vices has increased rapidly, resulting in an economic phenomenon centered on untact worldwide. Due to social distancing, the untact service area is expanding not only to shopping but also to online learning, home training, and telemedicine, and untact services are expected to expand to more diverse areas in the future. This study investigates four types of untact services: online lec- tures, online meetings related to work and study, online seminars, and online performances, and the effects of concerns about untact services on the intention of use have been examined using a path analysis model. As a result of the analysis, the perceived usefulness had a positive effect on the user's continuous intention to use untact services. However, depending on the type of untact service, it can be confirmed that the factors that affect the intention to continue using the service differ from each other.

abstract = {Innovation has been recognised as essential in a firm's success, but not all firms can actively engage in innovation activities due to their limited resources and the potential risks involved in such activities. In such a situation, a better understanding of the difference in the effects of the different innovation types is needed. However, little is known about the differences in technical efficiency in terms of innovation types. This study compared technical efficiency across different firms that applied different production function technologies differentiated by innovation type. Data from the seventh version of the Workplace Panel Survey of the Korean Labor Institute was used. Manufacturing firms that adopted a single innovation type were included in the final sample, based on the results of an exploratory data analysis. Using stochastic frontier analysis, the efficiencies of the four groups were estimated, and the efficiencies of different production function technologies were compared using meta-frontier analysis. The estimation results indicate that the organisation innovation group showed better efficiency than other groups, while the product/service innovation group exhibited the highest potential in its production technology.},

abstract = {Knowledge has replaced labor as the key factor for productivity growth in innovation discourse. The Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE) provides the theoretical foundation to bridge the gap between knowledge and productivity growth. The way regional knowledge actually contributes to productivity growth requires a theoretical explanation because knowledge capability is an indirect and intangible input for regional productivity growth. Previous research has shown that entrepreneurship alone is insufficient to drive productivity improvements. We examine how knowledge capabilities lead to meaningful growth outcomes of new firms in a region. This study examines the determinants of productivity growth by analyzing the factors of entrepreneurship and knowledge capabilities at the regional level, especially considering the moderating effect of entrepreneurship between knowledge and regional growth; by comparing different dimensions of local knowledge capabilities; and by aggregating the contribution of knowledge capabilities and entrepreneurship to productivity growth at the regional level. The empirical analysis is performed on Italian NUTS-3 regions by utilizing an integrated data set combining patent data from the EPO PATSTAT database, and regional data from Eurostat regional statistics. This study makes two main contributions to the KSTE literature by linking knowledge, entrepreneurship, and regional growth and by providing empirical results on different aspects of regional knowledge capability. Our findings identify which types of local knowledge capabilities are more important and how related innovative activity interacts with entrepreneurial activity, elucidating the mechanisms by which knowledge affects labor productivity through entrepreneurship.},

Using Web of Science publication data from European regions for the period between 2008 and 2017, this study examines, first, the impact of scientific collaboration on novelty of research. Here, five levels of collaboration are considered for each article–country, three levels of regions, and institutions, and novelty is measured with keywords information. Second, we investigate both the effect and moderating effect of research funding on novelty. Our findings show that there is a negative and significant relationship between scientific collaboration and novelty. Furthermore, funded papers show lower novelty than the unfunded, but funding does have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between collaboration and novelty. This study contributes by linking diverse levels of collaboration and funding sources to article's novelty and thus extending the scope of bibliometric research of publications.},

abstract = {In the 2000s, the European labour market experienced a number of significant changes including the transition to a more knowledge-intensive economy as well as the introduction of various economic policies (e.g. Eurozone, subsidized jobs, and social tax cuts). In times like these, the role of knowledge, which is essentially the driving force of innovation and thus promoting technological change and economic growth, is shifting due to new labour market conditions. The present study aims to explore how processes of local knowledge bases have been altered in this transformative environment and how these have impacted on local employment growth. The investigation considers three different knowledge bases in conjunction, incl. knowledge size, knowledge creation, and knowledge application. The study is based on an econometric analysis of a panel of 94 France NUTS-3 regions covering the period 1985–2015, utilizing patent data from European Patent Office (EPO) Statistical Patent Database (PATSTAT), and regional data from European Regional Database (ERD). The result shows that the role of knowledge for employment growth has indeed changed towards more specialized inputs in applications while the importance of greater knowledge size remains still important.},

However, little has known about how the knowledge recombination types affect differently to production efficiency at a regional level. This study explores the relationship between the knowledge recombination types of exploitation and exploration and regional technical efficiency by using the empirical data sets combining EPO PATSTAT, Eurostat, and Cambridge Econometrics regional database. For this purpose, three stages of analysis have been deployed. Firstly, CPC co-occurrence network analysis and relative comparative advantage (RCA) measures are used to construct knowledge space and measure regional capacity. Then, using the stochastic frontier analysis, the production efficiencies of the European NUTS 2 regions are measured. With all estimated measures, the effects of both exploration and exploitation of knowledge recombination on regional production efficiencies are estimated. The results show the positive effect of exploration on regional production efficiency, which highlights the importance of extending the range and variety of knowledge bases.},

In extant studies, transition failure has mostly been treated at the regime level, and the effects of a failed niche have been often ignored as if they do not impact the established system. Although the impact of failed niches is inconsequential compared to that of successful niches, regime actors can still interact and reinforce mutual stability within the existing regime and make either a positive or a negative impact even after the failed niches disappear. This study explains the effects of the failed niche, which attempted transition to a new socio-technical system, from a novel perspective. By revisiting the triple embeddedness framework, South Korea's shared mobility market has been selected as the representative case for transition failure. We find that failed shared mobility services in South Korea affecting regime stability through regime actors' networks, institutional inertia, and the imprinting effect. Our results highlight the significance of transition failure and provide adequate regulatory intervention to overcome regime barrier.},

abstract = {In pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, developing and commercializing products require great investments and intensive clinical trials. To manage the risk and uncertainty of such product development, especially given the low success rates, product diversification and collaboration strategies can be instrumental for firms. Especially, the differences in product development complexity and market condition among industries require more case-specific implication due to the absence of a universally applicable strategy, even in these two similar industries. To date, little is known or discussed regarding whether product diversification and collaboration strategies work differently by industry and to what extent their impact differs across industries. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of product diversification on firm performance and compares the diversification effects between pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Related product diversification (RPD), which involves diversifying existing product functions, and unrelated product diversification (UPD), which involves diversifying the selling market, are considered here, and their linear and curvilinear effects are examined for each industry. Furthermore, the mediating role of product diversification in the relationship between collaboration and performance is examined to explore diversification through collaboration and the effect of collaboration on firm performance. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level dataset combining a full set of commercialized product information, collaboration, and statistics from Medtrack and Compustat are used. The results indicate that UPD enhances pharmaceutical firms' performance, while RPD and UPD contribute to biopharmaceutical firms' performance. In both cases, mediating effect of product diversification is found; however, collaboration is found to play different roles, thereby showing that collaboration enhances product diversification for pharmaceutical firms, while for biopharmaceutical firms it negatively affects product diversification, but positively affects performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on how diversification should be treated differently across industries by considering product development complexity and market maturity.},

In this study, we discuss the diffusion and acceptance of SM services in South Korea's mobility market and its prospects from the perspective of socio-technical transitions. We designed a feedback model based on socio-technical system perspective to clarify the causal relationship between information and communication technology innovation and regulation in South Korea's mobility market; further, we applied a system dynamics simulation technique for testing three policy scenarios. We find that the diffusion of SM services is likely to be hampered if the current regulation is maintained and that the regulation reform without special measures could cause taxi services to lose a competitive advantage against SM services. Research and development investment through subsidies from SM services in the taxi industry innovation could encourage competitiveness, which could coexist with SM services, thereby bringing about a social benefit to adopters.},

South Korea was selected as its COVID-19 prevention strategy focused not only on the provision of medical support, but also on the enhancement of social trust through active engagement with people through media channels. Our results revealed that the perceived characteristics of online news and social media influence preventive actions through the trust in citizens or in the government. In addition, while online news media enhances trust in both the citizens and the government, social media only influences trust in citizens. Based on our findings, we concluded and discussed the role of media in preventing the spread of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Due to high uncertainty of product development and business environment, firm-level diversification has been regarded as one of the most effective methods in pharmaceutical firms. In previous study, firm-level diversification was discussed by different value chains of market, product, and technology. However, in most cases, the diversification itself was adopted in a simple manner although its property contains different aspects and the results varies depending on the diversity property of selected index. In addition, the existing approach for measuring firm's product/market diversification using sales information distinguished by standard industry classification cannot provide direct implication as different strategies are made for market and product diversification. Therefore, this study examines the effects of firm-level diversification on business and innovation performances in pharmaceutical firms by considering (1) three diversification types: market, product, and technology, (2) clear separation between market and product diversification, and (3) two diversification perspectives: balance-centred and hetero-centred. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level data set combining from Medtrack, Orange Book, Compustat and Total Patent database is used. From the result, in case of market diversification, less market heterogeneity causes significant influence on business performance. For product and technology, a concentrated and greater heterogeneity of product diversification are turned out to promote business performance, while the more intensive and heterogeneous technology diversification has been shown to improve innovation performance.},

However, the increasing and pervasive dependence on IT from organizations have raised a lot of concerns on the topic of IT governance (ITG). ITG and innovation do not have had the attention among academics. This study aims to examine the relationship among effective ITG, ITG relevant knowledge and how they influence innovation product and process. This study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate 215 valid surveys that were collected from members of the respective local chapters located in Bogot{\'{a}}-Colombia of the following institutions: Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and Project Management Institute (PMI). In addition, members of the Colombian computer science engineers association (ACIS) also participate answering our survey instrument. Our study found that ITG has positive and significant influence on innovation product and process. ITG relevant knowledge influences positively ITG especially when ITG experience is high, however, when the ITG experience is low, its effect is perceived as negative on innovation product and process.},

The evolution of IT encourages firms to have more concerns about the role that IT is playing for achieving strategic goals. Worldwide is known that companies are making huge investments in IT acquisitions and also in how govern its complexity. As a result, IT governance gains attention among organizations. This study reviews individual IT governance mechanisms and their influence on IT governance effectiveness. The study examines how IT Intensity use by firms and IT governance experience influence IT governance effectiveness. - The IT governance mechanisms selected were IT strategy committee, IT steering committee, involvement of senior management in IT, corporate performance measurement systems, ethics and culture of compliance, and corporate communication Systems. This study uses structural equation modelling to evaluate 293 valid surveys collected from members of the ISACA and PMI in Bogot{\'{a}} as well as the Colombian Association of Computer Science Engineers (ACIS). This study found that corporate communication systems and IT strategy committee have a positive and significant influence on the overall IT governance effectiveness. In firms with less than 10 years of IT governance experience, the influence of IT strategy committee is higher.},

abstract = {This paper studies the contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to productivity both directly – and indirectly, via externalities that originate in other sectors or countries. Building upon the theoretical model proposed by Basu et al. (2003), we include several features to account for two important aspects of ICT: complementarity with other intangibles, and externalities among different sectors. We propose several measures of externalities, distinguishing between foreign and domestic spillovers, and inter- and intra-industry spillovers. We focus on domestic spillovers, and compare a standard measure with a measure computed by weighting the ICT capital of other industries with bilateral sectoral trade. We find that results are affected by the way spillovers are measured. Evidence in favour of domestic externalities is only found when using the second measure, meaning that spillover effects only exist among industries that are connected via international trade. Foreign spillover effects are not detected.},

The analysis is conducted at industry level. GVC participation is analysed using network centrality measures calculated from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), while intangible valuation is obtained from the Intan-Invest database. Our unbalanced panel consists of 14 countries and 16 industries observed for the period 2000-2014. The analysis is based on a two-stage procedure. First, a proxy for total factor productivity (TFP) is obtained by estimating a production function with labour and non-ICT capital as inputs. Secondly, estimated TFP is used to evaluate how several types of intangibles and GVC measures affect productivity. Moreover, we use interaction terms in order to estimate jointly the impact of the two factors and evaluate the role of intangibles in the transmission mechanism between GVC and productivity. Both GVCs and intangibles were found to be significant drivers of productivity. Moreover, we find a combined effect of the two variables, with intangibles that moderate the relation between GVC and productivity.},

abstract = {The implacable list of diversification indices allows a wide range of selection opportunities for the researchers. The absence of consensus on the selection of suitable technology diversification index, however, may lead to a lack of objectivity with ample grounds. In this study, we focus on the case of technology diversification using patent to derive empirical implication for selecting suitable diversification index. To obtain the content validity of diversification index, three cases were tested: cross section, single and multiple time periods. As a result, diversification indices are separated into two groups: HHI, Gini-Simpson, 1/HHI, and Entropy for PC1 and Variety and Rao-Stirling for PC2. In this context, technology diversification can be explained by two perspectives of diversification: balance-centered and hetero-centered diversification. The balance-centered diversification implies the proportion of elements are the target of interest while hetero-centered diversification refers to variety and disparity of diversification, which focuses on the degree of differentiation among elements. In applicant-level technology diversification studies, these two diversification perspectives are recommended to be used.},

abstract = {As a consequence of the convergence between manufacturing technology and the foundation technologies of Industry 4.0, it is becoming more important for firms to formulate an innovation strategy for their technological capabilities. In this context, the present study measures firm-level technology convergence (TC) capability using patent network analysis. A firm's TC capabilities are measured using three centrality indices pertaining to a patent network, which is constructed based on the relationship between patents and their international patent classification. For the empirical analysis, panel regression is conducted to observe the effect of TC capabilities on innovation for the top 30 firms in four manufacturing industries. We find that the TC degree positively influences the firms' overall innovation, namely their total number of patents, and negatively influences their convergent innovation, calculated as the ratio between the number of TC patents and the total number of patents, while the effect of TC betweenness is the opposite. These findings imply that while concentrating on similar technologies may promote quick technology application, it could hamper the enhancement of a TC's potential. To promote TC, a firm should thus develop technologies more likely to be involved in TC.},

This analysis administered questionnaires to users of water purification systems installed in five elementary and middle schools in Binh Dinh, from which 296 samples were collected for the final analysis. The original unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was modified by incorporating the factors of physical support and educational support, and empirically studied using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that all constructs significantly affect the behavioral intentions toward AT, of which performance expectancy and physical support have the most significant impact. Thus, understanding local needs and improving the quality of life by spreading AT are key in its acceptance and diffusion. Furthermore, sustainable technology is guaranteed only if human and economic support is accompanied by AT development that fits the local context and environment. Finally, the analysis results, that moderating effects differ by role, imply that educational support's influence varies between manager and student groups.},

The Korean government has prohibited mobile network providers from providing excessive subsidies for mobile handsets to attract subscribers since Nov. 2014 according to the mobile act. Using the exogenous variation, we estimate the impact of the policy on the intention to change handsets and expenses on handset installment, total mobile communications, and online content. The longitudinal data are from the 2014 to 2015 waves of the Korea Media Panel Survey. The mobile act lowered the predicted probability of switching handsets by 0.4% points. Moreover, the mobile act increased the predicted probability of any expense on handset installment by 7.5% points and had a significant impact on the amount of expenses on handset installment, with an increase of 7.8%. The mobile act lowered users' willingness to switch handsets and increased spending on handset installment. This increased burden in handset installment might shrink the online content market, which has a large need for government support, as well as decrease consumers' welfare. We assert that the policy intervention on handset subsidies is questionable with regard to both consumer welfare and the healthiness of the ICT ecosystem.},

abstract = {This paper aims to uncover the mechanism of how the network properties of regional knowledge spaces contribute to technological change from the perspective of regional knowledge entry-relatedness and regional knowledge entry-potential. Entry-relatedness, which has been previously employed to investigate the technology evolution of regional economies, is advanced by introducing a knowledge gravity model. The entry-potential of a newly acquired regional specialisation has been largely ignored in the relevant literature; surprisingly given the high relevance that is attributed to the recombination potential of new capabilities. In other words, just adding new knowledge domains to a system is not sufficient alone, it really depends on how these fit into the existing system and thus can generate wider economic benefits. Based on an empirical analysis of EU-15 Metro and non-Metro regions from 1981 to 2015, we find that entry-relatedness has a significant negative association with novel inventive activities, while entry-potential has a significant positive association with the development of novel products and processes of economic value. This highlights that regions' capacity to venture into high-potential areas of technological specialization in the knowledge space outperforms purely relatedness driven diversification that is frequently promoted in the relevant literature.},

However, little has known about how the knowledge recombination types affect differently to production efficiency at a regional level. This study explores the relationship between the knowledge recombination types of exploitation and exploration and regional technical efficiency by using the empirical data sets combining EPO PATSTAT, Eurostat, and Cambridge Econometrics regional database. For this purpose, three stages of analysis have been deployed. Firstly, CPC co-occurrence network analysis and relative comparative advantage (RCA) measures are used to construct knowledge space and measure regional capacity. Then, using the stochastic frontier analysis, the production efficiencies of the European NUTS 2 regions are measured. With all estimated measures, the effects of both exploration and exploitation of knowledge recombination on regional production efficiencies are estimated. The results show the positive effect of exploration on regional production efficiency, which highlights the importance of extending the range and variety of knowledge bases.},

abstract = {The diversification of regions into new technologies is driven by the degree of relatedness to existing capabilities already present in the region. In cases where opportunities for diversification are rather limited, external knowledge that spills over from neighboring regions or from farther away might become an important driver of regional diversification. Despite the relative importance of interregional knowledge flows via collaborative work, we still have a very limited understanding of how collaboration networks across regions might facilitate diversification processes. The present study investigates the diversification patterns of European metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions into new knowledge domains via technology classes reported in patent applications to the European Patent Office. The findings indicate that externally oriented inventor collaboration networks increase the likelihood that a new technology specialization enters a region, but this external orientation is less important for related diversification than for unrelated diversification. Further, the results demonstrate that interregional collaboration networks help diversification into unrelated technologies if external knowledge sourcing is based on a diverse set of regions and if collaboration is intense within companies located in distinct regions.

abstract = {We examine how firm capabilities and regional knowledge bases co-evolve by studying Nortel, a major telecommunications manufacturer, in its home region of Ottawa–Gatineau and in the regions it rapidly entered during the late-1990s dot- com boom. We introduce a patent-based measure of technological similarity be- tween firms and regions to operationalize their potential compatibility and embed it in a “knowledge-space” mapping approach. Across locations, inventive produc- tivity, proxied by patent output, is higher where Nortel's technological profile is most similar to the host region's specialization. Technological similarity is a strong predictor of Nortel's local patenting rates and, during corporate decline, greater technological embeddedness is associated with slower local exit. These results dem- onstrate that aligning firm capabilities with regional strengths materially influences innovative performance and location dynamics. The proposed knowledge-space tool offers a replicable method for business location decisions and for regional policy seeking to attract, retain, and upgrade technology-intensive activity.},

abstract = {In today's highly competitive markets, firms can no longer ensure competitive advantage through the development of highly complex technologies or differentiation based solely on technological and functional factors. Simultaneously, there is growing recognition that design and aesthetic factors can contribute to firms' competitive advantage. Hence, this study examines the relationship between technology complexity, design innovation, and firm performance to uncover the role of design innovation in exploiting complex technologies. Our main hypothesis is that design innovation positively moderates the negative effect that technology complexity has on firm performance. We used a unique dataset that aggregates all patent data published by US-headquartered publicly-traded firms to the parent company level. We combined this dataset with the Computat and PATSTAT databases based on their matching firm identifier. Focusing on 1,743 firms from 1980 to 2015, the results support our hypotheses. This study contributes to the resource-based view of firms by recognising design as a strategic resource that firms can utilise to gain a competitive advantage, especially in the presence of high technology complexity.},

abstract = {Regional diversification and innovation depend on how well existing knowledge bases align with emerging scientific domains. Conventional measures of relatedness, however, rely on static classification systems that struggle to capture the interdisciplinary and dynamic nature of modern knowledge production. This study introduces semantic proximity as a novel, text-based approach to assess the cognitive alignment between regional scientific activity and new fields. Drawing on scientific publications from European NUTS-3 regions between 2010 and 2021, we employ BERTopic and BERT-based similarity to map regional knowledge spaces and measure their proximity to quantum science, an interdisciplinary field of high strategic importance. Using negative binomial regression models, we find that regions with higher semantic proximity to quantum science generate significantly more quantum-related publications. By moving beyond rigid taxonomies, the concept of semantic proximity provides a more flexible and fine-grained tool for analyzing regional knowledge evolution. Our findings extend evolutionary economic geography and offer actionable insights for policymakers seeking to foster smart specialization and guide regional innovation strategies in emerging technologies.},

abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to investigate how knowledge recombination contributes to innovation during digital transformation, focusing on business method (BM) patents. It introduces the concepts of dominant and spark technologies to capture different types of cognitive proximity in the innovation process. The research aims to reveal how these distinct knowledge types influence the creation of BM innovations across regions. By mapping knowledge interactions in patent networks, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of technological emergence and highlights their strategic relevance for knowledge- intensive organizations and regions navigating digital change. Design/methodology/approach – Using patent data from the European Patent Office (1981–2015), the study constructs co-occurrence-based knowledge spaces to map technological proximity and recombination. Two types of technologies are defined: dominant (widely combinable) and spark (highly BM-specific), measured via weighted centrality in network analysis. Regional-level indicators are developed, and fixed-effects negative binomial regression models are employed to evaluate their impact on BM patent output. This approach integrates cognitive proximity theory and evolutionary economic geography into empirical knowledge mapping, enabling analysis of regional innovation through a knowledge management lens. Findings – The analysis shows that both dominant and spark technologies significantly contribute to the creation of BM patents, though their effects vary by regional innovation capacity. Dominant technologies, broadly used across patenting activity, support general recombination, while spark technologies are tightly linked to BM-specific innovations. Notably, spark technologies exert greater influence in metropolitan regions with stronger innovation ecosystems. These findings highlight the differentiated roles of knowledge types in innovation and demonstrate that knowledge recombination dynamics are context-dependent. The study also confirms the value of cognitive proximity metrics in predicting innovation outputs. Originality/value – This study extends knowledge management theory by operationalizing and empirically testing cognitive proximity through patent-based knowledge spaces. It introduces actionable metrics – dominant and spark technologies – that offer new ways to evaluate knowledge recombination potential. Unlike traditional studies focused solely on knowledge stock or diffusion, this work emphasizes structural relationships between knowledge domains and their implications for business innovation. The findings offer valuable guidance for firms, regions, and policymakers seeking to foster innovation in the digital economy by aligning knowledge strategies with technological convergence patterns and local knowledge structures.},

While this spatial concentration is well-documented, most studies focus on individual crime types, overlooking how different crimes co-occur. Addressing this gap, this study examines spatial co-occurrence patterns of crimes in New York City from 2008 to 2018. By constructing a crime network, it identifies “brokerage” crimes that connect distinct crime groups. The analysis explores both the clustering of similar offenses and connections between crimes of differing severity, drawing on theories such as repeat victimization and the disorder–crime relationship. Using betweenness centrality, the study highlights crimes like prostitution, drug offenses, and robbery as key bridging offenses. These brokerage crimes, though less frequent, are strongly associated with higher levels of violent and property crime. The findings suggest that targeting such offenses could be crucial for disrupting broader crime patterns and inform more proactive law enforcement strategies.},

We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year.

This study compared technical efficiency across different firms that applied different production function technologies differentiated by innovation type. Data from the seventh version of the Workplace Panel Survey of the Korean Labor Institute was used. Manufacturing firms that adopted a single innovation type were included in the final sample, based on the results of an exploratory data analysis. Using stochastic frontier analysis, the efficiencies of the four groups were estimated, and the efficiencies of different production function technologies were compared using meta-frontier analysis. The estimation results indicate that the organisation innovation group showed better efficiency than other groups, while the product/service innovation group exhibited the highest potential in its production technology.},

abstract = {This study extends evolutionary economic geography to science by mapping how regional scientific capabilities emerge and evolve across Europe. Using Web of Science publications (2000–2017) geo-coded to 1,216 regions in 35 countries and classified into 228 subjects, we construct a pan-European “Science Space” based on subject co-occurrence and relatedness, and test whether relatedness density, i.e., the embeddedness of a subject in a region's existing portfolio, predicts subsequent entry (Revealed Scientific Advantage ≥ 1). Network evidence shows Europe's science system becoming more interdisciplinary, with technology-adjacent subjects (e.g., nanoscience, robotics, computer science) gaining centrality, while Life Sciences & Biomedicine remain dominant by volume. Econometric results (pooled OLS and GLM for binary entry, with region/subject/period fixed effects and controls for the regional economy and knowledge base) indicate that higher relatedness density significantly raises the likelihood of scientific entry. The effect is stronger in non-metropolitan regions and when a subject's initial RSA is very low, consistent with relatedness seeding new capabilities rather than merely consolidating near-threshold strengths. These findings generalise the principle of relatedness from technology to science and advise regional innovation policy to prioritise adjacent scientific opportunities, invest in bridging infrastructures, and design interdisciplinary platforms where relatedness density is high but specialisation has not yet emerged.},

abstract = {As innovation increasingly requires the integration of technological functionality with aesthetic design and user experience, firms benefit from inventors who can operate across both domains. This study investigates dual-domain inventors—those who contribute to both utility and design patents—as a distinct category of innovation talent. While prior research has emphasized technological specialization, less is known about how inventors who bridge design and technology contribute to innovation outcomes. Using a dataset of patents from 3,110 US public firms, we compare the inventive performance of dual-domain inventors to those engaged solely in technology development. The results show that dual-domain inventors produce higher-value patents, particularly when their technological knowledge occupies central positions within the firm's internal knowledge network. These findings underscore the strategic value of integrating design and technology expertise in product development, highlighting how cross-domain capabilities and organizational knowledge positioning jointly enhance innovation outcomes.},

abstract = {In today's highly competitive markets, firms can no longer ensure competitive advantage through the development of highly complex technologies or differentiation based solely on technological and functional factors. Simultaneously, there is growing recognition that design and aesthetic factors can contribute to firms' competitive advantage. Hence, this study examines the relationship between technology complexity, design innovation, and firm performance to uncover the role of design innovation in exploiting complex technologies. Our main hypothesis is that design innovation positively moderates the negative effect that technology complexity has on firm performance. We used a unique dataset that aggregates all patent data published by US-headquartered publicly-traded firms to the parent company level. We combined this dataset with the Computat and PATSTAT databases based on their matching firm identifier. Focusing on 1,743 firms from 1980 to 2015, the results support our hypotheses. This study contributes to the resource-based view of firms by recognising design as a strategic resource that firms can utilise to gain a competitive advantage, especially in the presence of high technology complexity.},

abstract = {This paper aims to uncover the mechanism of how the network properties of regional knowledge spaces contribute to technological change from the perspective of regional knowledge entry-relatedness and regional knowledge entry-potential. Entry-relatedness, which has been previously employed to investigate the technology evolution of regional economies, is advanced by introducing a knowledge gravity model. The entry-potential of a newly acquired regional specialisation has been largely ignored in the relevant literature; surprisingly given the high relevance that is attributed to the recombination potential of new capabilities. In other words, just adding new knowledge domains to a system is not sufficient alone, it really depends on how these fit into the existing system and thus can generate wider economic benefits. Based on an empirical analysis of EU-15 Metro and non-Metro regions from 1981 to 2015, we find that entry-relatedness has a significant negative association with novel inventive activities, while entry-potential has a significant positive association with the development of novel products and processes of economic value. This highlights that regions' capacity to venture into high-potential areas of technological specialization in the knowledge space outperforms purely relatedness driven diversification that is frequently promoted in the relevant literature.},

abstract = {Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3) are implemented across European regions. However, investigations into whether S3 initiatives adequately match local knowledge capabilities are very scarce. This work analyses to what extent S3 policies are coherent with the local knowledge space of 164 European regions, respectively. We show to what extent regional S3 policies target ‘central' technologies, and to what degree S3 policies also target ‘potential' sectors of knowledge production in specific regional settings. Our findings provide a solution for how S3 policies could be designed in the future to overcome the gap between S3 vision and the reality of constraints in regions.},

abstract = {Global scientific output is expanding exponentially, which in turn calls for a better understanding of the science of science and especially how the boundaries of scientific fields expand through processes of emergence. The present study proposes the application of embedded topic modeling techniques to identify new emerging science via knowledge recombination activities as evidenced through the analysis of research publication metadata. First, a dataset is constructed from metadata derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The dataset is then used to generate a global map representing a categorical scientific co-occurrence network. A research field is defined as interdisciplinary when multiple science categories are listed in its description. Second, the co-occurrence networks are subsequently compared between periods to determine changing patterns of influence in light of interdisciplinarity. Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification. We present the results of the analysis to demonstrate the emergence of global interdisciplinary sciences and further we perform qualitative validation on the results to identify what the sources of the emergent areas are. Based on these results, we discuss potential applications for identifying emergence through the merging of global interdisciplinary domains.},

abstract = {We examine how firm capabilities and regional knowledge bases co-evolve by studying Nortel, a major telecommunications manufacturer, in its home region of Ottawa–Gatineau and in the regions it rapidly entered during the late-1990s dot- com boom. We introduce a patent-based measure of technological similarity be- tween firms and regions to operationalize their potential compatibility and embed it in a “knowledge-space” mapping approach. Across locations, inventive produc- tivity, proxied by patent output, is higher where Nortel's technological profile is most similar to the host region's specialization. Technological similarity is a strong predictor of Nortel's local patenting rates and, during corporate decline, greater technological embeddedness is associated with slower local exit. These results dem- onstrate that aligning firm capabilities with regional strengths materially influences innovative performance and location dynamics. The proposed knowledge-space tool offers a replicable method for business location decisions and for regional policy seeking to attract, retain, and upgrade technology-intensive activity.},

abstract = {Integrating design and technological innovations throughout the new product development process is essential for creating market-successful products. This study investigates how firms' capability to effectively combine design and technology—termed design-engineering capability—affects financial performance and moderates the link between innovation activity and performance. Drawing on patent data for 1,659 US-headquartered public firms from 1980 to 2015, we identify design engineers as inventors contributing to both design and utility patents, capturing their role as integrators of aesthetic, functional, and market considerations. Using panel generalised least squares regressions, our results confirm that design-engineering capability not only directly enhances financial performance but also strengthens the positive impact of innovation activity. Firms with higher shares of design engineers achieve greater returns from their innovation efforts, while those with lower integration capabilities may fail to translate technological advances into market success. These findings underscore the strategic value of cross-disciplinary expertise and the need for organiations to foster collaboration between design and engineering functions. By highlighting the performance benefits of design-technology integration, this study contributes to research on innovation management, human capital, and the resource-based view of the firm.},
