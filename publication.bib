abstract = {As innovation increasingly requires the integration of technological functionality with aesthetic design and user experience, firms benefit from inventors who can operate across both domains. This study investigates dual-domain inventors—those who contribute to both utility and design patents—as a distinct category of innovation talent. While prior research has emphasized technological specialization, less is known about how inventors who bridge design and technology contribute to innovation outcomes. Using a dataset of patents from 3,110 US public firms, we compare the inventive performance of dual-domain inventors to those engaged solely in technology development. The results show that dual-domain inventors produce higher-value patents, particularly when their technological knowledge occupies central positions within the firm's internal knowledge network. These findings underscore the strategic value of integrating design and technology expertise in product development, highlighting how cross-domain capabilities and organizational knowledge positioning jointly enhance innovation outcomes.},

abstract = {Technological collaborations are crucial for shaping the emergence of new regional technological specialisations. This article explores the relationship between technological networks formed between organisations, within and across regions, and the ability of these regions to branch into new technological fields. To identify the organisations' collaboration structure, we exploit patent co-applicant data and perform a network analysis of the organisations' collaborations for 245 European NUTS-II regions from 1990 to 2016. Panel regression analyses reveal that (1) a more locally oriented and less dense region-internal network, (2) a more diverse set of region-external linkages, and (3) a higher share of single applicants in a region are positively associated with the emergence of new technological specialisations. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a balance between the organisations' inward and outward orientation to acquire new technological specialisations. Regions must leverage both internal technological capabilities and external networks to foster processes of technological renewal.},

abstract = {Integrating design and technological innovations throughout the new product development process is essential for creating market-successful products. This study investigates how firms' capability to effectively combine design and technology—termed design-engineering capability—affects financial performance and moderates the link between innovation activity and performance. Drawing on patent data for 1,659 US-headquartered public firms from 1980 to 2015, we identify design engineers as inventors contributing to both design and utility patents, capturing their role as integrators of aesthetic, functional, and market considerations. Using panel generalised least squares regressions, our results confirm that design-engineering capability not only directly enhances financial performance but also strengthens the positive impact of innovation activity. Firms with higher shares of design engineers achieve greater returns from their innovation efforts, while those with lower integration capabilities may fail to translate technological advances into market success. These findings underscore the strategic value of cross-disciplinary expertise and the need for organiations to foster collaboration between design and engineering functions. By highlighting the performance benefits of design-technology integration, this study contributes to research on innovation management, human capital, and the resource-based view of the firm.},

We then examine the temporal stability of the high-crime cluster over time. We also longitudinally assess how our high-crime cluster classification is associated with the actual amount of crime while accounting for the measures of social and physical environments. We observed that about 6–12% of total areas are identified to be in the high-crime cluster. We also found that block groups identified to be high-crime cluster in one year are more likely to be that way in the next year.

Our key findings from econometric analysis are as follows: first, the implementation of social distancing policies leads to an increase in the adoption of wearable devices. Second, the strengthening of social distancing has caused a decrease in individual privacy concerns. Finally, a decrease in individual privacy concerns leads to an increase in wearable device adoption.

The present study proposes the application of embedded topic modeling techniques to identify new emerging science via knowledge recombination activities as evidenced through the analysis of research publication metadata. First, a dataset is constructed from metadata derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The dataset is then used to generate a global map representing a categorical scientific co-occurrence network. A research field is defined as interdisciplinary when multiple science categories are listed in its description. Second, the co-occurrence networks are subsequently compared between periods to determine changing patterns of influence in light of interdisciplinarity. Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification. We present the results of the analysis to demonstrate the emergence of global interdisciplinary sciences and further we perform qualitative validation on the results to identify what the sources of the emergent areas are. Based on these results, we discuss potential applications for identifying emergence through the merging of global interdisciplinary domains.},

Simultaneously, there is growing recognition that design and aesthetic factors can contribute to firms' competitive advantage. Hence, this study examines the relationship between technology complexity, design innovation, and firm performance to uncover the role of design innovation in exploiting complex technologies. Our main hypothesis is that design innovation positively moderates the negative effect that technology complexity has on firm performance. We used a unique dataset that aggregates all patent data published by US-headquartered publicly-traded firms to the parent company level. We combined this dataset with the Computat and PATSTAT databases based on their matching firm identifier. Focusing on 1,743 firms from 1980 to 2015, the results support our hypotheses. This study contributes to the resource-based view of firms by recognising design as a strategic resource that firms can utilise to gain a competitive advantage, especially in the presence of high technology complexity.},

However, direct collaboration between designers and engineers with heterogeneous knowledge presents challenges. In this context, the role of design engineers—professionals skilled in both design and engineering—becomes pivotal. This study categorizes inventors into three primary groups: engineers, designers, and design engineers based on the type of patent applications they hold and investigates their differences in knowledge portfolios and collaboration patterns. The study relies on patent data for 4,665 US publicly-traded firms from 1980 to 2015 from the PATSTAT database, and constructs two networks for each firm period: a social network of inventors and a knowledge network of knowledge elements. Findings show that design engineers are highly connected within the social network but have disconnected knowledge in the knowledge network in comparison to engineers. While design engineers may not be the primary drivers of firms' technological innovations, they facilitate interdisciplinary communication and decision-making, fostering a design-technology integrated new product development environment. This research has practical implications for firms seeking to optimize their innovation processes by creating interdisciplinary teams that harness the complementary strengths of engineers and design engineers.},

abstract = {The diversification of regions into new technologies is driven by the degree of relatedness to existing capabilities already present in the region. In cases where opportunities for diversification are rather limited, external knowledge that spills over from neighboring regions or from farther away might become an important driver of regional diversification. Despite the relative importance of interregional knowledge flows via collaborative work, we still have a very limited understanding of how collaboration networks across regions might facilitate diversification processes. The present study investigates the diversification patterns of European metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions into new knowledge domains via technology classes reported in patent applications to the European Patent Office. The findings indicate that externally oriented inventor collaboration networks increase the likelihood that a new technology specialization enters a region, but this external orientation is less important for related diversification than for unrelated diversification. Further, the results demonstrate that interregional collaboration networks help diversification into unrelated technologies if external knowledge sourcing is based on a diverse set of regions and if collaboration is intense within companies located in distinct regions. Within-firm collaborations across regions can compensate for missing related skills in metropolitan and in nonmetropolitan regions alike but are especially important in nonmetropolitan regions. These results provide new evidence about the importance of knowledge flows within multilocation firms in the technological knowledge diversification of regions.},

While the process of knowledge exchanges between the nexus is conceptually well grounded in relevant literatures, the absence of quantitative measures and assessments of such linkages may underestimate the importance of scientific knowledge inputs for generating high-impact innovative outcomes. In this regard, we propose a large quantitative analysis on knowledge externalities from science to technology by investigating patent citations to science data across European metropolitan regions. First, we construct a dataset of patent citations to scientific knowledge that includes information on the spatial origins of knowledge spillovers. Subsequently, the ratio of internal scientific knowledge sourcing to external sources and its effect on patent citation impact is evaluated. Findings suggest that regions with a higher reliance on their internal scientific resources tend to generate inventions with higher technological impact, and that a strong connection between science and technology is even more effective in advanced industrial regions.},

abstract = {This study aimed to answer the question of how media users will reallocate their sleep time when their main content channel changes from real-time broadcasting to selective viewing through the over-the-top (OTT) media streaming service. To draw a causal inference between OTT consumption and sleep patterns, the difference-in-difference (DID) estimation method was applied. With the DID approach, a clear distinction between treatment and control groups is essential because the main treatment effects can be screened by the compounding effects. While the conventional way of dividing two groups relies on the selection of limited variables, this study adopted random forest nearest-neighbor propensity score matching based on a machine learning algorithm to divide the two groups. This allows for meticulous matching of the two groups except for treatment. Results show that watching OTT late at night has a significant effect on reducing the total sleep duration on average by about 18–20 min (maximum about 30 min at 95% confidence level) and delaying bedtime by about 18 min (maximum about 26 min at 95% confidence level). This study showed that the selective viewing of content through OTT has the advantage of widening the range of content choices for media users and helping in arranging their time more autonomously, but watching content through OTT late at night leads to media users' departure from the existing sleep routine.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing awareness on environmental issues, the necessity to implement more sustainable technologies is becoming a central theme for policy makers and economic agents. The beneficial effects of these technologies are not restricted to the environmental sphere, but also concern economic activity. In the present study, building on the knowledge spillovers theory of entrepreneurship, we look at the role of regional knowledge capabilities in facilitating green-tech firm creation in German regions. Exploiting the European Patent Office PATSTAT database in order to build regional knowledge measures, and official German government sources concerning regional green entrepreneurship activity, we consider both knowledge capacity and knowledge diversity aspects. We differentiate patents in terms of quality, using citation-based measures, and adopt a recombinant knowledge approach to account for knowledge heterogeneity. Results highlight the key role played by knowledge capacity measures, such as absorptive and innovative knowledge capacity, in promoting entrepreneurship. Although, among knowledge diversity measures only related diversity is found to promote the creation of new firms.},

Due to social distancing, the untact service area is expanding not only to shopping but also to online learning, home training, and telemedicine, and untact services are expected to expand to more diverse areas in the future. This study investigates four types of untact services: online lec- tures, online meetings related to work and study, online seminars, and online performances, and the effects of concerns about untact services on the intention of use have been examined using a path analysis model. As a result of the analysis, the perceived usefulness had a positive effect on the user's continuous intention to use untact services. However, depending on the type of untact service, it can be confirmed that the factors that affect the intention to continue using the service differ from each other. Practitioners can use the results of this study when designing untact services in the future.},

In such a situation, a better understanding of the difference in the effects of the different innovation types is needed. However, little is known about the differences in technical efficiency in terms of innovation types. This study compared technical efficiency across different firms that applied different production function technologies differentiated by innovation type. Data from the seventh version of the Workplace Panel Survey of the Korean Labor Institute was used. Manufacturing firms that adopted a single innovation type were included in the final sample, based on the results of an exploratory data analysis. Using stochastic frontier analysis, the efficiencies of the four groups were estimated, and the efficiencies of different production function technologies were compared using meta-frontier analysis. The estimation results indicate that the organisation innovation group showed better efficiency than other groups, while the product/service innovation group exhibited the highest potential in its production technology.},

abstract = {Knowledge has replaced labor as the key factor for productivity growth in innovation discourse. The Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE) provides the theoretical foundation to bridge the gap between knowledge and productivity growth. The way regional knowledge actually contributes to productivity growth requires a theoretical explanation because knowledge capability is an indirect and intangible input for regional productivity growth. Previous research has shown that entrepreneurship alone is insufficient to drive productivity improvements. We examine how knowledge capabilities lead to meaningful growth outcomes of new firms in a region. This study examines the determinants of productivity growth by analyzing the factors of entrepreneurship and knowledge capabilities at the regional level, especially considering the moderating effect of entrepreneurship between knowledge and regional growth; by comparing different dimensions of local knowledge capabilities; and by aggregating the contribution of knowledge capabilities and entrepreneurship to productivity growth at the regional level. The empirical analysis is performed on Italian NUTS-3 regions by utilizing an integrated data set combining patent data from the EPO PATSTAT database, and regional data from Eurostat regional statistics. This study makes two main contributions to the KSTE literature by linking knowledge, entrepreneurship, and regional growth and by providing empirical results on different aspects of regional knowledge capability. Our findings identify which types of local knowledge capabilities are more important and how related innovative activity interacts with entrepreneurial activity, elucidating the mechanisms by which knowledge affects labor productivity through entrepreneurship.},

Using Web of Science publication data from European regions for the period between 2008 and 2017, this study examines, first, the impact of scientific collaboration on novelty of research. Here, five levels of collaboration are considered for each article–country, three levels of regions, and institutions, and novelty is measured with keywords information. Second, we investigate both the effect and moderating effect of research funding on novelty. Our findings show that there is a negative and significant relationship between scientific collaboration and novelty. Furthermore, funded papers show lower novelty than the unfunded, but funding does have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between collaboration and novelty. This study contributes by linking diverse levels of collaboration and funding sources to article's novelty and thus extending the scope of bibliometric research of publications.},

In times like these, the role of knowledge, which is essentially the driving force of innovation and thus promoting technological change and economic growth, is shifting due to new labour market conditions. The present study aims to explore how processes of local knowledge bases have been altered in this transformative environment and how these have impacted on local employment growth. The investigation considers three different knowledge bases in conjunction, incl. knowledge size, knowledge creation, and knowledge application. The study is based on an econometric analysis of a panel of 94 France NUTS-3 regions covering the period 1985–2015, utilizing patent data from European Patent Office (EPO) Statistical Patent Database (PATSTAT), and regional data from European Regional Database (ERD). The result shows that the role of knowledge for employment growth has indeed changed towards more specialized inputs in applications while the importance of greater knowledge size remains still important.},

This study explores the relationship between the knowledge recombination types of exploitation and exploration and regional technical efficiency by using the empirical data sets combining EPO PATSTAT, Eurostat, and Cambridge Econometrics regional database. For this purpose, three stages of analysis have been deployed. Firstly, CPC co-occurrence network analysis and relative comparative advantage (RCA) measures are used to construct knowledge space and measure regional capacity. Then, using the stochastic frontier analysis, the production efficiencies of the European NUTS 2 regions are measured. With all estimated measures, the effects of both exploration and exploitation of knowledge recombination on regional production efficiencies are estimated. The results show the positive effect of exploration on regional production efficiency, which highlights the importance of extending the range and variety of knowledge bases.},

In extant studies, transition failure has mostly been treated at the regime level, and the effects of a failed niche have been often ignored as if they do not impact the established system. Although the impact of failed niches is inconsequential compared to that of successful niches, regime actors can still interact and reinforce mutual stability within the existing regime and make either a positive or a negative impact even after the failed niches disappear. This study explains the effects of the failed niche, which attempted transition to a new socio-technical system, from a novel perspective. By revisiting the triple embeddedness framework, South Korea's shared mobility market has been selected as the representative case for transition failure. We find that failed shared mobility services in South Korea affecting regime stability through regime actors' networks, institutional inertia, and the imprinting effect.

abstract = {This paper aims to uncover the mechanism of how the network properties of regional knowledge spaces contribute to technological change from the perspective of regional knowledge entry-relatedness and regional knowledge entry-potential. Entry-relatedness, which has been previously employed to investigate the technology evolution of regional economies, is advanced by introducing a knowledge gravity model. The entry-potential of a newly acquired regional specialisation has been largely ignored in the relevant literature; surprisingly given the high relevance that is attributed to the recombination potential of new capabilities. In other words, just adding new knowledge domains to a system is not sufficient alone, it really depends on how these fit into the existing system and thus can generate wider economic benefits. Based on an empirical analysis of EU-15 Metro and non-Metro regions from 1981 to 2015, we find that entry-relatedness has a significant negative association with novel inventive activities, while entry-potential has a significant positive association with the development of novel products and processes of economic value. This highlights that regions' capacity to venture into high-potential areas of technological specialization in the knowledge space outperforms purely relatedness driven diversification that is frequently promoted in the relevant literature.},

abstract = {In pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, developing and commercializing products require great investments and intensive clinical trials. To manage the risk and uncertainty of such product development, especially given the low success rates, product diversification and collaboration strategies can be instrumental for firms. Especially, the differences in product development complexity and market condition among industries require more case-specific implication due to the absence of a universally applicable strategy, even in these two similar industries. To date, little is known or discussed regarding whether product diversification and collaboration strategies work differently by industry and to what extent their impact differs across industries. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of product diversification on firm performance and compares the diversification effects between pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Related product diversification (RPD), which involves diversifying existing product functions, and unrelated product diversification (UPD), which involves diversifying the selling market, are considered here, and their linear and curvilinear effects are examined for each industry. Furthermore, the mediating role of product diversification in the relationship between collaboration and performance is examined to explore diversification through collaboration and the effect of collaboration on firm performance. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level dataset combining a full set of commercialized product information, collaboration, and statistics from Medtrack and Compustat are used. The results indicate that UPD enhances pharmaceutical firms' performance, while RPD and UPD contribute to biopharmaceutical firms' performance. In both cases, mediating effect of product diversification is found; however, collaboration is found to play different roles, thereby showing that collaboration enhances product diversification for pharmaceutical firms, while for biopharmaceutical firms it negatively affects product diversification, but positively affects performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on how diversification should be treated differently across industries by considering product development complexity and market maturity.},

In this study, we discuss the diffusion and acceptance of SM services in South Korea's mobility market and its prospects from the perspective of socio-technical transitions. We designed a feedback model based on socio-technical system perspective to clarify the causal relationship between information and communication technology innovation and regulation in South Korea's mobility market; further, we applied a system dynamics simulation technique for testing three policy scenarios. We find that the diffusion of SM services is likely to be hampered if the current regulation is maintained and that the regulation reform without special measures could cause taxi services to lose a competitive advantage against SM services. Research and development investment through subsidies from SM services in the taxi industry innovation could encourage competitiveness, which could coexist with SM services, thereby bringing about a social benefit to adopters.},

In this study, the role of online news and social media on people's preventive actions considering the role of trust in citizens and government from the perspective of social capital is investigated. For the empirical study, a structural equation modeling is employed by using survey material gathered from South Korea in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. South Korea was selected as its COVID-19 prevention strategy focused not only on the provision of medical support, but also on the enhancement of social trust through active engagement with people through media channels. Our results revealed that the perceived characteristics of online news and social media influence preventive actions through the trust in citizens or in the government. In addition, while online news media enhances trust in both the citizens and the government, social media only influences trust in citizens. Based on our findings, we concluded and discussed the role of media in preventing the spread of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Due to high uncertainty of product development and business environment, firm-level diversification has been regarded as one of the most effective methods in pharmaceutical firms. In previous study, firm-level diversification was discussed by different value chains of market, product, and technology. However, in most cases, the diversification itself was adopted in a simple manner although its property contains different aspects and the results varies depending on the diversity property of selected index. In addition, the existing approach for measuring firm's product/market diversification using sales information distinguished by standard industry classification cannot provide direct implication as different strategies are made for market and product diversification. Therefore, this study examines the effects of firm-level diversification on business and innovation performances in pharmaceutical firms by considering (1) three diversification types: market, product, and technology, (2) clear separation between market and product diversification, and (3) two diversification perspectives: balance-centred and hetero-centred. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level data set combining from Medtrack, Orange Book, Compustat and Total Patent database is used. From the result, in case of market diversification, less market heterogeneity causes significant influence on business performance. For product and technology, a concentrated and greater heterogeneity of product diversification are turned out to promote business performance, while the more intensive and heterogeneous technology diversification has been shown to improve innovation performance.},

abstract = {This paper studies the contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to productivity both directly – and indirectly, via externalities that originate in other sectors or countries. Building upon the theoretical model proposed by Basu et al. (2003), we include several features to account for two important aspects of ICT: complementarity with other intangibles, and externalities among different sectors. We propose several measures of externalities, distinguishing between foreign and domestic spillovers, and inter- and intra-industry spillovers. We focus on domestic spillovers, and compare a standard measure with a measure computed by weighting the ICT capital of other industries with bilateral sectoral trade. We find that results are affected by the way spillovers are measured. Evidence in favour of domestic externalities is only found when using the second measure, meaning that spillover effects only exist among industries that are connected via international trade. Foreign spillover effects are not detected.},

The analysis is conducted at industry level. GVC participation is analysed using network centrality measures calculated from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), while intangible valuation is obtained from the Intan-Invest database. Our unbalanced panel consists of 14 countries and 16 industries observed for the period 2000-2014. The analysis is based on a two-stage procedure. First, a proxy for total factor productivity (TFP) is obtained by estimating a production function with labour and non-ICT capital as inputs. Secondly, estimated TFP is used to evaluate how several types of intangibles and GVC measures affect productivity. Moreover, we use interaction terms in order to estimate jointly the impact of the two factors and evaluate the role of intangibles in the transmission mechanism between GVC and productivity. Both GVCs and intangibles were found to be significant drivers of productivity. Moreover, we find a combined effect of the two variables, with intangibles that moderate the relation between GVC and productivity.},

In this study, the case of the standards war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray was analyzed with patent data as an empirical case considering a dynamic framework. With this framework, we observed a change in a firm's technology relations and could predict the decline in a firm's preference and the shift of equilibrium ahead of Toshiba's resignation.},

abstract = {The implacable list of diversification indices allows a wide range of selection opportunities for the researchers. The absence of consensus on the selection of suitable technology diversification index, however, may lead to a lack of objectivity with ample grounds. In this study, we focus on the case of technology diversification using patent to derive empirical implication for selecting suitable diversification index. To obtain the content validity of diversification index, three cases were tested: cross section, single and multiple time periods. As a result, diversification indices are separated into two groups: HHI, Gini-Simpson, 1/HHI, and Entropy for PC1 and Variety and Rao-Stirling for PC2. In this context, technology diversification can be explained by two perspectives of diversification: balance-centered and hetero-centered diversification. The balance-centered diversification implies the proportion of elements are the target of interest while hetero-centered diversification refers to variety and disparity of diversification, which focuses on the degree of differentiation among elements. In applicant-level technology diversification studies, these two diversification perspectives are recommended to be used.},

abstract = {As a consequence of the convergence between manufacturing technology and the foundation technologies of Industry 4.0, it is becoming more important for firms to formulate an innovation strategy for their technological capabilities. In this context, the present study measures firm-level technology convergence (TC) capability using patent network analysis. A firm's TC capabilities are measured using three centrality indices pertaining to a patent network, which is constructed based on the relationship between patents and their international patent classification. For the empirical analysis, panel regression is conducted to observe the effect of TC capabilities on innovation for the top 30 firms in four manufacturing industries. We find that the TC degree positively influences the firms' overall innovation, namely their total number of patents, and negatively influences their convergent innovation, calculated as the ratio between the number of TC patents and the total number of patents, while the effect of TC betweenness is the opposite. These findings imply that while concentrating on similar technologies may promote quick technology application, it could hamper the enhancement of a TC's potential. To promote TC, a firm should thus develop technologies more likely to be involved in TC.},

This analysis administered questionnaires to users of water purification systems installed in five elementary and middle schools in Binh Dinh, from which 296 samples were collected for the final analysis. The original unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was modified by incorporating the factors of physical support and educational support, and empirically studied using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that all constructs significantly affect the behavioral intentions toward AT, of which performance expectancy and physical support have the most significant impact. Thus, understanding local needs and improving the quality of life by spreading AT are key in its acceptance and diffusion. Furthermore, sustainable technology is guaranteed only if human and economic support is accompanied by AT development that fits the local context and environment. Finally, the analysis results, that moderating effects differ by role, imply that educational support's influence varies between manager and student groups.},

abstract = {This study examined effect of a policy intervention that provides an upper limit for handset subsidies on users' intention to change handset and households' expenses on mobile telecommunications. The Korean government has prohibited mobile network providers from providing excessive subsidies for mobile handsets to attract subscribers since Nov. 2014 according to the mobile act. Using the exogenous variation, we estimate the impact of the policy on the intention to change handsets and expenses on handset installment, total mobile communications, and online content. The longitudinal data are from the 2014 to 2015 waves of the Korea Media Panel Survey. The mobile act lowered the predicted probability of switching handsets by 0.4% points. Moreover, the mobile act increased the predicted probability of any expense on handset installment by 7.5% points and had a significant impact on the amount of expenses on handset installment, with an increase of 7.8%. The mobile act lowered users' willingness to switch handsets and increased spending on handset installment. This increased burden in handset installment might shrink the online content market, which has a large need for government support, as well as decrease consumers' welfare. We assert that the policy intervention on handset subsidies is questionable with regard to both consumer welfare and the healthiness of the ICT ecosystem.},
